# GOOD README GENERATOR

## Description

A README generator that takes user input using Node.js.

When prompted for information about the application repository, a quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. When the project title is entered, it is displayed as the title of the README. When all the corresponding information is entered, the information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests. When a license is chosen for the application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added hear the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under. When a GitHub username is entered it s added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to the GitHub profile. When an email address is entered, it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach the user with additional questions. When clicking on the links in the Table of Contents, the user is taken to the corresponding section of the README.
