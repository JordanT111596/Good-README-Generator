When the project title is entered, it is displayed as the title of the README. When all the corresponding information is entered, the information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests. When a license is chosen for the application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added hear the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under. When a GitHub username is entered it s added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to the GitHub profile.
